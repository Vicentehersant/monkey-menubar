# Claude Code hook -> mascot state. Writes one small JSON file per session into
# ~/.claude/monkey/sessions/, which Monkey.app watches with FSEvents.
#
# Invariants:
#   - always exit 0; a bug here must never block or slow a session
#   - write atomically, so the watcher never reads a half-written file
#   - bash + jq only, no interpreter startup cost in the session's critical path
#
# States: idle | working | asking | done   (plus the pseudo-state "end" = remove)

# Stop fires the instant the assistant's turn ends, even if the last thing it

# real work — e.g. a multi-minute transcription. Without this check that reads
# as "done" for however long the background job takes, then flips back to
# "working" once its completion is surfaced as a fresh turn. Resolved by
# looking at the last *inbound* (role "user") transcript entry, whatever form
# it took:
#   - still the "Command running in background with ID: ..." acknowledgment
#     -> nothing has checked on it since, the job hasn't resolved -> "working"
#   - a <task-notification>...</task-notification> message -> the background
#     job already finished (or failed) and got surfaced as its own turn, so
#     the pending state is resolved -> leave STATE alone
# A completed background job resolves as a synthetic <task-notification> user
# turn, not a new tool_result, so checking tool_result alone (as an earlier
# version of this check did) would find the stale acknowledgment forever and
# get stuck showing "working" even after the job was long done.

# Claude Code fires no hook at all on a manual interrupt (Escape) — Monkey falls

# with no heartbeat in Tuning.staleWorkingTimeout is presumed interrupted). That
# heuristic would misfire here: a backgrounded shell can legitimately run far
# longer than that timeout with no further hook activity at all until it
# resolves. pendingBackground tells the app "this working state is a known,
# deliberate wait, not silence to be suspicious of" — cleared automatically the
# moment any other hook writes this file normally again.
